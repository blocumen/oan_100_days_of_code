UseCase - Animal Experience places 

Problem statement:
Animal cruelty is a big problem at Animal Experience places. To earn more, at some places animals are trained by torture without any consiquences. Some of Animal experience places are good where they keep only rescued animals. Right now it's difficult to find out if the owner is lying or not because the data is not easily available to the public so we have to believe what the owner is saying.  

Solution was derived from three ideas:
* Moves app - Giving voice to people who are suffering unintended consequences
* Everledger - Trying to eliminate blood diamonds with blockchain technology
* I <3 animals

Solution: A blockchain based application which tracks and maintains all rescued animals. Every animal has their record entered. When they were rescued. From where they were rescued. Medical record etc. 

Once we have some data we can partner up with places which provide Animal Experiences. We will verify if all the animals they have are actually rescued and give them certification.

* It will help places boost confidence with their customers, investors, and donors. 
* Every animal will have a story to tell which is verifiable.

The intention of this application is not to demonize these places. These places work very hard in dangerous places with low budgets to make sure animals are rescued and kept safe. 

The idea is to separate foxes from sheeps to build more confidence so that the right money can be allocated to the right cause.

Thank you and stay safe!
